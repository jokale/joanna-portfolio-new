                <h3>My name is Joanna if I hadn't already mentioned</h3>
                <p>I am a junior web developer, but leaning towards frontend development. <br></br> 
                I was not always a developer, I intially studied Economics and Politics (which I actually found interesting) <br></br> 
                Till I realised I wanted to get into technology, specfically UX/UI <br></br>
                After much delibaration I figured it would be better to become a Full stack developer <br></br> 
                The rest was history, I began to self teach after I graduated university in July 2019 up until Decemeber of 2019 whereby I enrolled in Flatiron School <br></br>
               Software Engineering Immersive course and finished in June 2020 and have been coding and learning ever since <br></br> Including this very portfolio you are looking at.
