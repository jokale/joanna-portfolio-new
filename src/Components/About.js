                <h3>My name is Joanna if I hadn't already mentioned</h3>
                <p>I am a junior web developer, but leaning towards frontend development. <br></br> I was not always a developer, I intially studied Economics and Politics (which I actually found interesting) <br></br>
                Until one day whilst in my third year of university sitting in a boring lecture I thought to myself I don't want to be an economist or politician. <br></br> Despite the intensity of my final year of university I set on a task to find what I truly liked and enjoyed doing and what I could see myself doing. <br></br>
                I have always considered myself somewhat creative yet stifled by more 'academic' choices from a levels up until university. <br></br> I battled with the idea of UX/UI having seen someone on Twitter speak about it and how much they enjoyed it. After much research and lots of deliberation, I was set I was going to be a UX/UI developer. <br></br> 
                I was so sure but then I thought to myself where do I start? I scrowered the internet emailing people with the job title, emailing agenicies if they had any internships. No reply. <br></br> Speaking to my brother in law (former Software Engineer now working in DevOps) I expressed my disappointment....
